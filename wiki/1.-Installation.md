Welcome to the setup wiki.

# Getting Started
You should do these tasks in order.  There may be some little issues with setup, so please let me know if one of the components is broken or you can't get everything set up correctly.

**1. Download and install the Java JDK**  

Link: <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>

I use Oracle's Java 8.  Download the appropriate Java 8 JDK (development kit) for your system.  I believe that the latest version will work fine.  We're not doing such outrageous things that we have to really worry about compatibility issues between different Java releases or even different JDKs.



**2. Sign up for GitHub**

Link: <http://github.com>

GitHub will be our interim code repository.  Get an account (it's free) and use your Schneider email.  To be clear _Git_ is a version control software package and _GitHub_ is an online portal to host and manage your repositories.  Our software team uses a slightly different interface for Git.

**3. Install GitHub Desktop**

Link: <https://desktop.github.com/>

Download and install the latest version of GitHub Desktop. This will automatically install GitHub and keep it up-to-date for you.  Don't worry about using this tool, we will be doing most of the Git work directly in the development environment.

**4. Install Git**

Link: <http://git-scm.com/download/win> (for Windows download)

Accept all defaults.


**4. Setup HipChat**

Link: <http://www.hipchat.com/>

I'd like to give HipChat a try for team discussions and collaboration.  This will allow us to communicate in groups on tasks whether we are in the office or not.  Again, you'll have to sign up for an account (preferably with your Schneider email).  HipChat can be accessed from iOS, Android, Mac/Windows Desktop, or a browser -- without VPN, so it might be good for work-at-home days.  It also stores conversations, which immediately makes it better than vanilla SameTime.  Email me (chris.healey@schneider-electric.com) for the HipChat room invite.

**5. Install IntelliJ IDEA Community**

Link: <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/>

IntelliJ is one of many IDE options.  For our purposes, all of the IDEs will produce exactly the same product, some have more useful features like code completion, warnings, navigation, integrations with GitHub, etc.
