# Git Basics and Example

**1. Open or Create a Task**
In general, we always want to create branches when we want to implement changes.  The easiest way to do this within IntelliJ is to start a task which will automatically create a branch to solve that problem.  The new branch that we create is a version of the code that is marked as independent of the master branch (or build code).  That way we have a separate place where we can play with code and save code in an interim basis.  When we're done with our changes, we'll merge our changes with the master branch (and then remove the interim branch).
